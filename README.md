## Architecture

![architecture](https://github.com/sarah911/NoSQL_Project/blob/master/Data/architecture.PNG)

## Configuration Cassandra

Replication Factor = 3
Write = QUORUM(2)
Read = ONE(1)

W + R = RF
Eventual consistency  

## EMR Automation
Scripts to automate the cluster creation:
1 - bootstrap_cassandra.sh : Bootstrap cassandra on cluster creation
2 - cluster_configuration.py : Configurate the cluster (number and types of instances etc) + link to spark and cassandra
3 - create_cluster.sh : Launch to create EMR
